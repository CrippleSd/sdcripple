# sdcripple
# welcome to my project
# Note this is my first program on Github

1- THIS IS A SIMPLE HELLO WORLD APP SAYS "CRIPPLE SD"
2- NOTE THIS IS NOT A BUILDED APP "YOU MUST BUILD IT BY YOURSELF"
3- TO MAKE THIS CODE RETURN AN APP YOU MUST CREATE THE FOLLOWING FOLDERS
A - src
e.g ⬇
1 src
     > 2 cripplesd
         > 3 apps
             > 4 fprogram

e.g "src ➡ cripplesd ➡ apps ➡ fprogram"
 After you create these sub-folders so you have to move the file MainActivity.java to the last sub-folder fprogram
e.g ⬇
" 1 src
          > 2 cripplesd
              > 3 apps
                  > 4 fprogram
                     > 5 MainActivity.java "

B - res
e.g ⬇
1 res
   > 2 layout
   > 3 mipmap
After you create these sub-folders so you need to move the file main.XML to the sub-folder of res "layout"
e.g ⬇
 res
   > layout
      > main.xml
After you move the file main.xml to the layout folder so you have to find image with the resolution either 140 x 140 or 100 x 100 with the name icon.PNG
e.g ⬇
  res
    > mipmap
       > icon.png




# THE END !!
